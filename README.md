## About the project
The idea of this project not only arises from the challenge of how to take advantage of the benefits and features of a microcontroller like the MSP432P401R, but also from how to provide a solution to a real-world problem.
For this reason, the implementation of a solar tracker was chosen. In this way, we could enhance the efficiency of solar panels by enabling active tracking of the sun's movement throughout the day.
Our goal for this solar tracker project is to implement it in the simplest way possible, leveraging the inherent functionality of the MSP432P401R and avoiding the use of other types of microcontrollers. All of this within a structure capable of providing support and stability for the photoresistors, solar panels, and transmitters that will enable the movement of the entire structure.
